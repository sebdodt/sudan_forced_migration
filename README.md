### Predicting forced migration based on weather and conflict data

The relationship between climate change and migration has been contested among scientists, influencing how policymakers may respond. The predictions by climate migration researchers are distributed on a large spectrum, from forecasting billions of climate refugees1 to saying there is no causal relationship between climate and large- scale migration.2 There are several debates about the multi-causal dynamics that drive migration, the accuracy and viability of long-term predictions, as well as the overall
concern of whether such predictions do more harm than help solving the issue.

In this paper, I will seek to unify some of the concerns of critics with the chances offered by the ability to predict forced migration, not least in the response to humanitarian crises. Machine learning methods will be used to make inferences about correlations between extreme weather patterns and forced migration, while controlling for other confounders such as human conflict. Building on highly detailed survey data from the International Organisation of Migration, I will be able to demonstrate a causal relationship between extreme weather events and migration.

My analysis will avoid controversial assumptions of existing quantitative analysis: the claim of accuracy over long-term predictions, the dependency on correlations, and
generalisations over many states and continents. Instead, my model will employ a local case study—the Sudan and South Sudan—and making inferences focusing on the quality of data and robustness of statistical tools used. This localised approach will add a piece to the big puzzle of predicting climate migration which is yet to be solved by climate scientists and statisticians.
